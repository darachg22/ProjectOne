Darach Gorham Project One

Overview:
This folder contains all of the documents of my project. 
The project creates a syntesised dataset based on the following problem statement:

Problem statement

For this project you must create a data set by simulating a real-world phenomenon of
your choosing. You may pick any phenomenon you wish – you might pick one that is
of interest to you in your personal or professional life. Then, rather than collect data
related to the phenomenon, you should model and synthesise such data using Python.
We suggest you use the numpy.random package for this purpose.

Specifically, in this project you should:
- Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could
collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.
- Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their
relationships with each other.
- Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.
- Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook – the
data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.

Exploring the content:
The work is contained within the 'DarachGorham.Project.ipynb' jupyter notebook file.
The file needs a number of libraries in order to run: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn. 

The folder contains an excel file containing a real life suvey to help inform the sythestic datset (Leaving_cert_students.xlsx). 
It also contains two screenshots of the microsoft form sent out to leaving certificate students (SurveyOneScreenshot.png, SurveyTwoScreenshot.png)

Description:
As mentioned, this is a fully sythesized dataset to try to simluate a real life phenomonon. 
The synthesised dataset has 7 columns: 
1.Student number
2.Average Grade
3.Going to Third-Level
4.Part-time Job
5.Study hours per night
6.Overall view of the school
7.Gender
8.Age
The findings are then plotted in the notebook to study the data.
